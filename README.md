pong
====
A simple ncurses pong-game I did for a course at Freiburg-University in 2011.

dependencies
------------
- linux (I do not know if it builds on other platforms)
- ncurses
- libm, libgcc, libc

build
-----
To build the project just type 'make'.
This will create an exetutable called 'pong'.
